What is a data binding?
Data binding is a core concept in Angular and allows to define communication between a component and the DOM, making it very easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data. There are four forms of data binding(divided as 3 categories) which differ in the way the data is flowing.
From the Component to the DOM: Interpolation: {{ value }}: Adds the value of a property from the component
<li>Name: {{ user.name }}</li>
<li>Address: {{ user.address }}</li>
