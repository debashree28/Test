The compile() and link() functions define how the directive is to modify the HTML that matched the directive.

The compile() function can then do any one-time configuration needed of the element containing the directive.

The compile() function finishes by returning the link() function. 
The link() function is called every time the element is to be bound to data in the $scope object.
The compile() function takes two parameters: The element and attributes parameters.
The link() function takes three parameters: The $scope parameter, the element parameter and the attributes parameter.
Directives have access to the parent scope by default in AngularJS applications
Directives that use isolate scope provide 3 different options to interact with the
outside world (the world on the other side of the wall).
The 3 options are referred to as Local Scope Properties and
can be defined using the @, =, and & characters mentioned earlier. Hereâ€™s how they work.
