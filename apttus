extend html
reusable component
The compile() and link() functions define how the directive is to modify the HTML that matched the directive.
The compile() function is called once for each occurrence of the directive in the HTML page. 
The compile() function can then do any one-time configuration needed of the element containing the directive.

The compile() function finishes by returning the link() function. 
The link() function is called every time the element is to be bound to data in the $scope object.
The compile() function takes two parameters: The element and attributes parameters.
The link() function takes three parameters: The $scope parameter, the element parameter and the attributes parameter.
